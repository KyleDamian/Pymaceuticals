With datasets from a clinical trial and of lab mice an analysis was performed using python to chart the growth rate of the tumors, the change of the metastatic sites, and the survival rate of the mice by each type of drug used in the study. From the analysis it was discovered that one particular drug showed both a reduction in tumor growth and the highest survival rate in mice.
